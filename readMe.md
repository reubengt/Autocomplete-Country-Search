## Project Description
A simple autocomplete widget that accepts a search input and shows an auto-updating list of completed inputs.
Specifically it uses the list of countries and gives the opportunity to visit that country Wikipedia.

## Installation

1 - Clone the repository

2 - Run `npm install` -> that will install all the dependencies for you :)

## User stories 

As a user visiting this site, I should be able to
- [x] Type in a query into a search input
- [x] See a list of suggested queries that start with the text I entered
- [x] See an **updated list** of suggestions each time I input a new character into the search field
- [x] Be able to choose a suggestion from the list with the mouse

Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Use an external API to populate the data
- [x] Be able to use keyboard to navigate suggestions
- [x] Use the widget value to navigate to Wikipedia
